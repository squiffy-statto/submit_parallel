# submit_parallel
<br>
SAS Macro tool that allows users to wrap standard by process code into a wrapper macro and run in parallel.
Calling this tool automatically splits the starting dataset up and runs each part in a child session before 
collating all the results the idea being no extra parallel code is needed from the user.
